Greetings fellow developer my name is Adit Patel. I am currently a software engineer working for the NDW Teradata DBA Team.
I really want to be expand my front end skillsets and delve into vue.js this term.

I would also like to attempt to use my environmental and developer skillsets to make my project environmental themed.


My motivation and drive for programming stems from my understanding that technology is the key to helping society become more sustainable. 

My calling is to help utilize my skill sets to serve as a driver of change.
