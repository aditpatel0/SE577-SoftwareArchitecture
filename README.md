Comments and thoughts for Project release 1 and 2:

Front-end:
Coming from front-end background with emphasis on javascript, VUE had a smooth learing curve. At this point in my journey, The Professor's lectures were mind blowing. I saw so much value in hearing from himself an industry expert teach us about best practices. I now have a new level or understanding of current and future industry from his perspective. 

I would love to explore VUE in my day to day here at Comcast. Its stateless and developer friendly capabilities, should be explored more within my team and my org.

One huge take away was need for speed and quickness when it comes to applications. I took a deeper dive into the benefits and draw backs of Single Page Applications.


Code Management:
I also looked back and saw there was a need for better managment of code so I decided it would be ideal to keep my frontend and backend seperate.
