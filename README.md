Comments and thoughts for Project release 1 and 2:

Front-end:
Coming from front-end background with emphasis on javascript, VUE had a smooth learing curve. At this point in journey, The Professor's lectures were mind blowing. I saw so much value in hearing from himself an industry expert teach us about best practices. I now have a new level or understanding of current and future industry from his perspective. 

One huge take away was need for speed and quickness when it comes to applications. I took a deeper dive into the benefits and draw backs of Single Page Applications.


Backend:
This was a very challenging step in my learning journey this term. I really needed to step back an understand how my front-end application would run. 
My journey led me to Rust. My work at Comcast has me dealing with data security,and training awarness. So what drew me to Rust was its benefits of code security and its well-documented error index of bad code. 

Code Management:
I also looked back and saw there was a need for better managment of code so I decided it would be ideal to keep my frontend and backend seperate.
