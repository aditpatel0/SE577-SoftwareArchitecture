Coments and thoughts on Proj-Release-3

Backend:
This was a very challenging step in my learning journey this term. 

The first stop was to get a better understanding of Node JS.
In this journey of discovery, right away I was intrigued by how well it can process data. I spend some on its benefits of non-blocking algorithms as well. Having the idea of microservices in mind, what I took was how fast NODEJS and starting to see glimpses of its overall benefits in the industry. 

My next was to try to get a better understanding of docker, and its benefits. My first takeways was its simplicity! To a degree... A tool that allows to you send your application to the cloud without any dependencies has my attention! The idea that you have the ability to created isolated environments and scale them up and down! For some reason my mind went straight to Spiderman 2 (2004) Doctor Octopus with his contained Sun. 

Its versaility in being able to be utilized in multiple cloud platforms was great too. 

This final stop in my backend development journey led me to Rust. My work at Comcast has me dealing with data security,and training awarness. So what drew me to Rust was its benefits of code security and its well-documented error index of bad code.
