This was a very challenging step in my learning journey this term. I really needed to step back an understand how my front-end application would run. 
My journey led me to Rust. My work at Comcast has me dealing with data security,and training awarness. So what drew me to Rust was its benefits of code security and its well-documented error index of bad code. 

I also looked back and saw there was a need for better managment of code so I decided it would be ideal to keep my frontend and backend seperate.
