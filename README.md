Coments and thoughts on Proj-Release-3

Backend:
This was a very challenging step in my learning journey this term. 

The first step was to get a better understanding of Node JS.
In this journey of discovery, right away I was intrigued by how well it can process data. I spend some on its benefits of non-blocking algorithms as well. Having the idea of microservices in mind, what I took was how fast NODEJS and starting to see glimpses of its overall benefits in the industry. 

This exploration led me to Rust. My work at Comcast has me dealing with data security,and training awarness. So what drew me to Rust was its benefits of code security and its well-documented error index of bad code.
